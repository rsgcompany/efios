	<string>&lt;p&gt;This Notice sets forth the terms and conditions under which EnjoyFresh LLC, a Florida limited liability company, and any features and services from the website “enjoyfresh.com” (collectively “EnjoyFresh”) provides information on this website, as well as the terms and conditions governing your use of this website, along with any additional terms and conditions that may be referenced herein or that are presented elsewhere on the website in relation to a specific service or feature. By making use of this website or being redirected here from another domain, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions that appear hereunder. The terms and conditions are subject to updating at any time without notice and such changes, additions or deletions shall be effective immediately upon posting. We may terminate, change, suspend or discontinue any aspect of the website, including the availability of any features of the website, at any time. If at any time you do not accept the terms and conditions, do not access the website or any of its pages. Changes to the terms and conditions take effect when posted to the website. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EnjoyFresh website allows restaurants (&quot;Restaurants&quot;) to market and offer for sale meals for delivery and/or pick up and customers to search for and purchase such meals. These services are conducted within the United States and only at certain locations. You should closely review the information concerning the Restaurants to ensure you are able to properly utilize and benefit from the EnjoyFresh services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Restaurants are obligated by EnjoyFresh to comply with federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations, and standards pertaining to food preparation, sale, marketing and safety. However, it is critical for you to understand that EnjoyFresh does not in any way independently verify the credentials, representations or products of Restaurants, the ingredients or the quality of any products, or that a Restaurant is in compliance with applicable laws. You must make yourself comfortable through information provided by Restaurants on the EnjoyFresh website or as requested by you directly from the Restaurants as to the quality and reliability of the Restaurants, as well as to their compliance with applicable laws. EnjoyFresh does not in any way guaranty the quality of any food or that any food complies with applicable laws. In addition, a Restaurant may represent that food preparation is in accordance with special standards such as &quot;organic,&quot; &quot;kosher,&quot; &quot;macrobiotic&quot; or allergen-specific standards such as &quot;nut-free,&quot; &quot;gluten-free,&quot; or &quot;lactose-free.&quot; However, EnjoyFresh does not independently investigate or verify such representations. EnjoyFresh shall not be liable or responsible for any food or services offered by Restaurants that is unhealthy, is the cause of injury, that is otherwise unacceptable to buyers or that does not meet the expectation of buyers in any manner. You are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy of delivery addresses, and EnjoyFresh shall have no liability or responsibility for any such erroneous addresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;NO WARRANTY – DISCLAIMER – INDEMNITY

This website is controlled and operated by EnjoyFresh from offices within the Orange County, Florida, United States of America where you submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts. We make no representation that materials at this website are appropriate or available for use outside of the United States or that access to their content from all territories is legal. You may not use the website or export the website materials in violation of U.S. laws and regulations. If you access this website from locations outside of the United States, you are responsible for compliance with all local laws. These terms and conditions which you have agreed to by visiting this website must be governed by the laws of the United States and of the State of Florida, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Ordering Products and Services &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt; You must be 18 years or older, and have a valid credit card, with full authority to use it, to submit an order for products or services through any of EnjoyFresh websites. If you are a minor, you must have your parent or guardian read and agree to this Agreement prior to you using the Website. Persons under the age of 13 are not permitted to register for the EnjoyFresh website or use the EnjoyFresh website services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All ordering is performed online. You will typically be billed directly by EnjoyFresh for your orders, and &quot;EnjoyFresh&quot; will be the name that appears on your payment records, but EnjoyFresh shall not in any manner be considered the seller of the food. On occasion, credit card information will be provided to the Restaurants, and in such case, the Restaurant will bill you directly. You will be notified at the time of purchase if the Restaurant will be billing you directly. In such case, you hereby authorize EnjoyFresh to transfer your credit card information to the Restaurant for processing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt; Prices and Availability 
&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;All prices listed on EnjoyFresh websites are subject to change. In the event a product or service is listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect information due to typographical error or error in pricing or product information received from our suppliers, EnjoyFresh shall have the right, prior to the acceptance of your order pursuant to our Order Acceptance Policy described below, to refuse or cancel any such orders whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit card account charged. If your credit card account has already been charged for the purchase and your order is canceled, EnjoyFresh shall immediately issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount of the charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The availability of products or services and other items on each of EnjoyFresh websites may change at any time, without notice. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt; Terms of Purchase &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Payment is due at the time of order. You agree to pay all fees and charges incurred in connection with your purchases including any sales taxes, surcharges and any delivery fees for the delivery service you select. The final charges for your order may be different than those stated on the website. EnjoyFresh does not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, products, and content of any third parties related to the creation or delivery of your order. EnjoyFresh may require additional verification or information before accepting any order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By selecting to pay via credit card as a method of payment, you agree that you must be authorized to use the credit card presented as a method of payment.

If EnjoyFresh does not receive payment from your credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by EnjoyFresh or its agents. The final charges on your credit card may be different than those stated on the website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each customer shall be solely responsible for all sales taxes, or other taxes, customs, import/export charges, or similar governmental charges, if any. EnjoyFresh does not collect sales or use taxes in all states. For states imposing sales or use taxes, your purchase is subject to use tax unless it is specifically exempt from taxation. Your purchase is not exempt merely because it is made over the Internet or by other remote means. Many states require purchasers to file a sales/use tax return at the end of the year reporting all of the taxable purchases that were not taxed and to pay tax on those purchases. Details of how to file these returns may be found at the websites of your respective taxing authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without limiting other remedies, EnjoyFresh reserves the right to charge a late fee on all past due payments equivalent to the lesser of one and a half percent (1.5%) per month on the unpaid balance or the highest rate allowed by law. You will pay for all collection costs, attorneys fees, and court costs incurred in the collection of past due amounts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt; Order Acceptance Policy &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not signify EnjoyFresh acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of EnjoyFresh offer to sell. EnjoyFresh reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. EnjoyFresh reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order, without prior notice to you, to supply less than the quantity you ordered of any item. EnjoyFresh may require additional verifications or information before accepting any order. Your order is not accepted until EnjoyFresh sends you a receipt and/or pick-up information for the order (or the accepted portion thereof). Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that, if EnjoyFresh cancels all or a portion of your order or if EnjoyFresh provides you less than the quantity you ordered, your sole and exclusive remedy is either (a) EnjoyFresh will issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount charged for the cancelled portion or the quantity not provided (if your credit card has already been charged for the order) or (b) EnjoyFresh will not charge your credit card for the cancelled portion of the order or the quantity not provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Questions and Suggestions&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have questions or suggestions, please contact us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@enjoyfresh.com?Subject=Enjoy Fresh - Support&quot;&gt;info@enjoyfresh.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This agreement to which you consent constitutes the entire agreement between you and EnjoyFresh and its affiliated companies with respect to your use of our website.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Our Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with Personally Identifiable Information that EnjoyFresh collects through the website “enjoyfresh.com” from which you are accessing this policy and any microsites that EnjoyFresh may create in the future, and extranet sites that EnjoyFresh has now or may create or use in the future (collectively the &quot;websites&quot;). This Privacy Policy does not address the collection, use or disclosure of information by any of our affiliates or by third parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using the websites, you agree to the terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy, do not access the websites or any of its pages. We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy without prior notice, so please check back periodically. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will become effective upon our posting of the revised Privacy Policy on the websites. Please keep in mind that some of the services and products mentioned specifically in our Privacy Policy may not be available on the websites at this time. Use of the websites following such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy then in effect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Payments to Restaurants. &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt; At times when you place an order for food from a restaurant, EnjoyFresh may transfer all information to the restaurant necessary for preparing and processing the order. On occasion, this may include transferring credit card and other payment information in cases where a restaurant, rather than EnjoyFresh, is processing the payment. You will need to contact the restaurants directly to determine the privacy policies that apply to the information that EnjoyFresh transfers to the restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who is Collecting Information?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you are on EnjoyFresh websites and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with EnjoyFresh and its affiliates and service providers. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please be aware that other websites to which we may link may collect personally identifiable information about you when you visit those websites. The information practices of other websites linked to or from our websites are not covered by our Privacy Policy, and EnjoyFresh is not responsible for the activities, policies, or conduct of such sites. For information concerning the policies of such sites, you should review the privacy policies posted on those sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Types of Information Do We Collect From You? &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally Identifiable Information (or &quot;PII&quot;) is information that identifies you as an individual.

We and our third party service providers may collect Non-PII from you, including your MAC address, your computer type, screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser and demographic data, for example your location, gender and date of birth and we may aggregate PII in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the website. Additionally, we and our third party service providers may collect Non-PII when provided to us by you. We and our third party service providers may also use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, and other similar technologies to better serve you with more tailored information and facilitate your ongoing use of our websites. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline the use of cookies.

Your IP Address is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever users visit the Site, along with the time(s) of such visit(s) and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Why Do We Collect the Information from You? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you register at any of our websites, you will no longer be anonymous to EnjoyFresh and you will be able to take better advantage of our services. We may be better able to fulfill your orders and requests to deliver your orders or provide you with information that you request. We can also inform you of products, programs, services and promotions that we believe may be of interest to you. Additionally we may use PII for our internal business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, developing new products, enhancing our websites, improving our services, identifying usage trends and determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We reserve the right to ask you for your EnjoyFresh account information or a EnjoyFresh account number. We may ask you for information at other times, such as when you report a problem with our websites or services, or contact EnjoyFresh via the corporate or other e-mail addresses provided at the websites. If you contact EnjoyFresh, we may keep a record of that correspondence. EnjoyFresh reserves the right to collect the following additional personally identifiable information from you via the websites or via other means or methods:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;bull; Information necessary to install and use any new features we add to the web sites;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&amp;bull; Additional personal and company information if you become a customer or client of EnjoyFresh;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;bull; Pertinent payment and financial information, such as credit card information, bank account information, or other information necessary to effect payment for our services if you become a customer or client of EnjoyFresh;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&amp;bull; Your EnjoyFresh account number;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;bull; Such other information as may be necessary or useful for us to serve you.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you believe that any inaccurate or inappropriate information has been obtained or disseminated through your use of the websites, you should contact a representative of Enjoy Fresh LLC at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@enjoyfresh.com?Subject=Enjoy Fresh - Support&quot;&gt;info@enjoyfresh.com&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How Do We Use the Information?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt; EnjoyFresh primary goal in collecting information is to improve the websites and provide the user with the best possible experience on the websites.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EnjoyFresh will also use your personal information to notify you of other products or services available from EnjoyFresh and its affiliates. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EnjoyFresh may research its users&apos; demographics and behavior based on the information provided to us upon registration, gathered from transaction activity, from our server log files or from surveys. This research may be compiled, analyzed or sold on an aggregated basis, which does not include information identifying individual users. EnjoyFresh also may share this aggregated data with business partners or other third parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EnjoyFresh may also use your information in the ways stated immediately below under &quot;With Whom Do We Share Your Information?&quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;With Whom Do We Share Your Information?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ol id=&quot;account-info&quot; type=&quot;1&quot;&gt; &lt;li&gt;PII or Account Information. EnjoyFresh may provide your PII and account information to third parties under the following circumstances or for the following purposes:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;EnjoyFresh may provide such information for the purpose of processing that information on behalf of EnjoyFresh. Such disclosure is made to EnjoyFresh affiliates and trusted business partners or persons, and EnjoyFresh asks that such parties process the information only in accordance with EnjoyFresh instructions and maintain appropriate confidentiality and security measures.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;EnjoyFresh may provide such information for use in website hosting, packaging and mailing, order fulfillment, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail, providing investor information and processing data. Such disclosure is made to companies who may provide such services to EnjoyFresh. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EnjoyFresh may provide such information when EnjoyFresh has reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating EnjoyFresh Terms of Service, or may otherwise be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) EnjoyFresh rights or property, other EnjoyFresh website users or customers, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;EnjoyFresh may provide such information when EnjoyFresh believes in good faith that the law requires it, or for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service and improve our products and services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EnjoyFresh may provide such information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EnjoyFresh may provide such information when EnjoyFresh believes it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of EnjoyFresh terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;EnjoyFresh may provide such information if EnjoyFresh acquires, or is acquired by or merged with another company, or if EnjoyFresh sells or buys the assets of another person or company. In such transactions, confidential and personally identifiable customer or client information generally is one of the transferred business assets. In the event of a transaction involving the sale of some or all of EnjoyFresh businesses, customer and site visitor information may be one of the transferred assets.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data in the Aggregate. EnjoyFresh may disclose blinded aggregated data and user statistics to prospective partners and other third parties, as well as to others for lawful purposes. Blinded data is data which does not identify an individual person.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Can I Control My Personal Information?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may contact us at EnjoyFresh if you wish to view, edit or delete your personal information from our database, and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate your request. Moreover, as noted above, if you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service. We may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes, and there may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records, which will not be removed. Finally, we are not responsible for removing or suppressing information from the databases of third parties with whom we have already shared your PII, or limiting their use of your PII.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do We Protect Financial Information Collected on Our Websites?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;EnjoyFresh does not presently collect financial information via its websites; however, as stated above, it reserves the right to do so in the future.\n Security precautions to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of your information. \nYour EnjoyFresh Account Information and EnjoyFresh profile are password-protected; however, EnjoyFresh does not presently use encryption technology for passwords, registration, or other information. Further, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please do not send us sensitive information through email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We strongly recommend that you sign out of your EnjoyFresh account and close your browser window when you have finished your work or viewing of EnjoyFresh web sites. This is to ensure that others cannot access your account by using your computer when you are away from it.\n Because of the global nature of the World Wide Web and the Internet, when you give us information, that information may be sent electronically to servers outside of the country where you originally entered the information. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Since EnjoyFresh websites do not use security encryption measures, information that you disclose by use of this site (as with any site that is non-secure), by posting a message or using e-mail, potentially could be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties or use of such information by third parties for their own purposes, legal or illegal.\n As a result, although EnjoyFresh strives to protect your personal information, EnjoyFresh cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we use reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), you must immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us at EnjoyFresh&lt;/p&gt; What else should I know about my privacy?&lt;p&gt;Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose information online, that information is accessible to other customers and users. Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online.\nWhen you or EnjoyFresh end your customer relationship with us, we will treat the information we have about you as if you were still our customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Questions and Suggestions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have questions or suggestions, please contact us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:info@enjoyfresh.com?Subject=Enjoy Fresh - Support&quot;&gt;info@enjoyfresh.com&lt;/a&gt;.This agreement to which you consent constitutes the entire agreement between you and EnjoyFresh and its affiliated companies with respect to your use of our website. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
